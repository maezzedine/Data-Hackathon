https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynnabouhamzeh/,,"I am currently a first-year sociology and anthropology major at American University of Beirut.

Throughout my education, I contribute to positive results through effective organization, prioritization, and follow-through of projects. I exercise a methodical approach to problem-solving. While I am independently motivated, I am collaborative with peers and search for ways to integrate valuable insights. Further, my critical thinking, attention to detail, and decision-making abilities will serve to support continued organizational efforts.

Identifying improved approaches and enhanced solutions to challenges are activities that drive and inspire me. Exploration, pursuit, and motivation are my frameworks for success. I believe that fresh perspectives and trying new techniques help the community evolve and grow. 

My goal is to be on the cutting-edge of social advancements. I aim to foster a reputation as a key contributor through innovation and critical thinking skills. Through these qualities, I have confidence in my ability to facilitate positive change and collective effort.","Recruitment and Consulting Executive at Business Umbrella-Recruitment ,training & consulting","Beirut, Lebanon",Lynn,AbouHamzeh,Lynn AbouHamzeh,245,2nd,ACoAADMBc34ByY4Wv1nhpR_r4f6DGzXMdin2z4I,855733118,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAADMBc34ByY4Wv1nhpR_r4f6DGzXMdin2z4I,name",https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAADMBc34ByY4Wv1nhpR_r4f6DGzXMdin2z4I%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAADMBc34ByY4Wv1nhpR_r4f6DGzXMdin2z4I%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,5,"You and Lynn both know Mohamad Al Hajj Sleiman, Karim Abdel baki, and 3 others","Business Umbrella-Recruitment ,training & consulting",https://www.linkedin.com/company/business-umbrella/,Recruitment and Consulting Executive,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2021 – Present,My FELS,https://www.linkedin.com/company/myfels/,Brand Ambassador,Apr 2021 – Present,American University of Beirut,https://www.linkedin.com/school/14790/?legacySchoolId=14790,Bachelor's degree,Sociology and Anthropology,2020 – 2023,Amjad High School,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Amjad%20High%20School,High School Diploma,Helped reach out to influence and engage with communities to promote sound environmental behavior.,2012 – 2020,"Leadership, Communication, Analytical Skills, Data Analysis, Research, Research and Development (R&D), Sociology, IBM SPSS Statistics, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Outlook, Problem Solving, Critical Thinking, Presentation Skills, Qualitative Research, Teamwork, Strategic Thinking, Easily Adaptable, Active Listening, Data Analytics, Evaluations, Attention to Detail, Digital Communication, Cultural Understanding, Google Drive, Client Confidentiality",Leadership,3,Communication,2,Analytical Skills,3,Data Analysis,2,Research,1,Research and Development (R&D),0,https://lb.linkedin.com/in/lynnabouhamzeh,lynnabouhamzeh,2021-05-25T20:31:05.975Z,,,,,,,,,

Having keenness and quickness in understanding and dealing with a business situation, combined with my engineering background, I decided to pursue a career that encounters both. 

Being the highly competitive person I am today, I have been able to develop an exponential relationship between my goals and achievements. The more I achieve, the thirstier I get. Accordingly, the more goals I set, the higher the standards of perfection I seek.

Throughout my years at university, I’ve seized the opportunity to participate in several competitions to enhance my analytical skills. I also joined different clubs to put my leadership and communication skills into practice, and to ensure that my expectations and targets are exceeded.

I discovered my interest in Public Speaking in school, and since then, I’ve always wanted to continuously experience the feeling I had on stage. Needless to say, it became my passion. As a result, I hosted several events and participated in numerous programs such as LAU MUN where Public Speaking is crucial.

I always enjoy meeting new people and building new relationships so feel free to connect or reach out to me with job opportunities.
